## Lab tools supplement
Doing the labs also requires a few hand tools and supplies. When we teach the course on campus, these are available in the lab. When we teach it remotely, we send a supplemental pack of tools including:

- wire __stripper__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073YG65N2>
- needlenose __pliers__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AY5DQ>
- angled __cutter__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0829SSZJZ>
- solid core __wire__, 22-24 AWG
- an inexpensive, low-speed USB __logic analyzer__ that works with PulseView <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077LSG5P2>
- __HDMI cable__
- PS/2 __keyboard__ and __mouse__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BF15X>


## Sources for parts

We have found that parts from [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) are a good value, especially when purchasing in bulk, although it will take a few weeks to arrive.

We often purchase the boxes from [Daiso](https://www.daisojapan.com/) because their
physical stores have very good quality boxes for very cheap.

If looking to buy parts for your personal use, we also recommend [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/), [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), and [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) for their high-quality products and excellent customer service.
