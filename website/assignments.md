## List of assignments

## Assignment schedule
The quarter starts with a set of 7 weekly assignments. Each week's assignment is released after lab each week and due before the next week's lab. These assignments fit together to construct a complete working computer system of your very own -- so cool! You will use the final weeks of the quarter to design and complete a final project of your own choosing.

## Common questions about assignments
---
*Written by Pat Hanrahan and Julie Zelenski*

### What is the expected assignment workload?

Students in previous quarters report spending between 10 and 20 hours completing each of the weekly assignments.
The assignments build on each other,
and it is difficult to recover from skipping an assignment. 
The last assignment is a final project, 
and you will have two weeks to do the project. 
The final project is more open-ended than the assignments.
Most students will spend more than 20 hours on their final project.

### What programming environment and tools are used?

Students will use their own laptop for the assignments.
If you use a Mac,
you will be using the Terminal program and command line tools.
If you use Windows,
you will install a subsystem running Ubuntu linux to use
 for your assignments.

When developing on the Raspberry Pi,
you will compile programs on your laptop and download them to the Raspberry Pi.
We use a suite of open-source cross-development tools for arm processors that include  `gcc` , `gdb`, and `binutils`.
Other tools such as `make` and `git` will also be used.
You will also be expected to become proficient with the unix shell and 
a unix text editor such as `emacs` or `vi`.

Assignments are distributed to students as `git` repositories.
You edit, compile, and debug programs in the local assignments repository on your laptop. When finished, 
you submit by creating a pull-request. Consult [Assignment 0](/assignments/assign0/) for information about using git.

### What is the policy on late assignments?

Assignments are due weekly at end of day Tuesday 11:59pm Pacific. On-time submission is awarded a small bonus that boosts course grade. After the deadline is a 2-day grace period that allows late submission with no penalty. All submissions are expected by end of the grace period.  Read our [course late policy](/policies/#late-policy)
for specifics.

### What is the assignment collaboration policy?

The programming assignments are to be done individually and should represent
independent, original work. We adhere to the Stanford and CS department Honor
Code policies, and offer specific examples of its application to CS107E
coursework in our [course collaboration
policy](/policies/#collaboration-policy).

The final project is usually done in teams of 2 or 3. If working in a team, all partners are expected to contribute equally to the effort.

### How are assignments structured?
Each assignment writeup has a required basic part and various optional extensions. 

The __core features__ are required of all students. The work follows directly from the material covered in lecture and lab. It has a tight specification to which your submission is expected to match precisely. We provide suggested steps to guide you through completing the core part. 

The __extensions__ are optional add-ons that allow you to explore further and earn additional points. These are not required, but it is highly encouraged that you attempt some of the extensions. Extensions are given with a looser specification and much less guidance than the core features. If tackling an extension, you will need to research advanced material on your own and apply your creativity in problem-solving.

In assignments 2 through 7, you will build up a library of useful utilities for bare metal programming on the Raspberry Pi.  These assignments build on one another. To complete assignment 5, say, you will need working versions of assignments 2 through 4. 

If you do not complete the core part of an assignment,
you may have trouble completing the next assignment.
To help you in these situations, we provide our
reference implementations.
If your version doesn't work,
you can fall back on our version.

The last assignment requires you to use code from
many of the previous assignments.
To encourage you to complete all assignments and resubmit to fix your bugs,
if you submit the last assignment using only your own code,
we will award you additional bonus points for building a complete working system. 

### How are assignments graded?
We test functionality by exercising your code against our grading tests. For each bug or test failure, we file a GitHub issue to report the problem. An issue is categorized with its priority, Priority 1 being the most important and decreasing from there.  For full credit on the core functionality, you must have passing results on all of the Priority 1 tests. You are encouraged to revise and resubmit in order to address any Priority 1 issues.  Lower priority bugs can be addressed at your discretion. A higher percentage of passed tests boosts your course grade.

We will also look at your code and assess the code quality.
Good code should be decomposed into small, clear, well-named functions so that 
no code is repeated and it is easy to follow the intent of each function.

We evaluate code quality using a bucket system. Code that needs 
improvement falls in the `-` bucket, code that meets our expectations is in the 
`ok` bucket, and exceptional code falls in the `+` bucket.
We will also provide comments on your code 
to help you improve your code quality.
Please incorporate our feedback into future assignments;
it will improve your grade and more importantly your coding style.

For details on course grades, see our [course grading
policy](/policies/#grading-policy).

## What is the revise and resubmit policy?
If our grading feedback from your assignment submission indicates one or more failed test cases on core functionality, you are encourage to review the bug reports and rework your code to fix the underlying bug(s). When you submit the revised code, we will run the tests again and update your quality metrics to show the now-passed results.
